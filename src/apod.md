Ongoing.

I run the official Tumblr mirror of [NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/).

This now runs pretty much on autopilot. I wrote a Python script that scrapes the official page every morning and posts it to Tumblr via its API. My script runs on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/5ddc4153469e).
